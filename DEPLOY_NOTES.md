# Deployment Prep
- Tests not run (pytest/pip unavailable in tuning environment)
- Built and natural beauty pillars are now first-class; legacy neighborhood_beauty responses removed from the public API
- Analysis directory trimmed to diagnostics-only artifacts
- Natural beauty pillar enhanced with multi-radius canopy sampling, NDVI-based GVI, biodiversity entropy, and canopy expectation adjustments
