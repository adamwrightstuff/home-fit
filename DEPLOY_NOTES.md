# Deployment Prep
- Tests not run (pytest/pip unavailable in tuning environment)
- Beauty split refactor: built_beauty/natural_beauty now first-class pillars; legacy neighborhood_beauty retained for compatibility
- Analysis directory trimmed to diagnostics-only artifacts
- Natural beauty pillar enhanced with multi-radius canopy sampling, NDVI-based GVI, biodiversity entropy, and canopy expectation adjustments
