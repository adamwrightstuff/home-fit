## Proposed Additions - 12 Locations

These locations address gaps in the current panel. **Research these to establish new target scores.**

### Priority 1: More Exurban Locations (4 locations)

**Gap:** Current panel has only 1 exurban location (Park City). Need 3-4 more for better statistical power.

| # | Location | Proposed Area Type | Context | Expected Score Range | Research Notes |
|---|----------|-------------------|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| 19 | Asheville NC | exurban | Mountain town, outdoor recreation hub | 85-95 | Known for hiking, Blue Ridge access |
| 20 | Bend OR | exurban | Outdoor recreation mecca, high desert | 90-95 | Top outdoor recreation destination |
| 21 | Flagstaff AZ | exurban | Mountain town, desert edge, Grand Canyon gateway | 80-90 | High elevation, trail access |
| 22 | Missoula MT | exurban | Mountain town, river access | 85-95 | Outdoor recreation hub |

**Research Sources:**

| # | Location | Proposed Area Type | Context | Expected Score Range | Research Notes |
|---|----------|-------------------|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| 23 | Downtown Houston TX | urban_core | Dense urban, limited parks, hot climate | 35-45 | Low outdoor access, urban sprawl |
| 24 | Downtown Dallas TX | urban_core | Dense urban, limited parks, hot climate | 40-50 | Similar to Houston, slightly better |
| 25 | Downtown Indianapolis IN | urban_core | Mid-size city, moderate parks | 50-60 | Mid-range urban core |
| 26 | Downtown Kansas City MO | urban_core | Mid-size city, moderate parks | 55-65 | Mid-range urban core |

**Research Sources:**
- Trust for Public Land ParkScore rankings
- City park system reports
- Urban green space studies

### Priority 3: Diverse Suburban (3 locations)

**Gap:** Current suburban locations are mostly high-scoring. Need diversity in contexts (desert, mountain, coastal).

| # | Location | Proposed Area Type | Context | Expected Score Range | Research Notes |
|---|----------|-------------------|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| 27 | Suburban Phoenix AZ (Scottsdale) | suburban | Desert suburban, golf courses | 60-70 | Desert context, limited natural access |
| 28 | Suburban Denver CO (Golden) | suburban | Mountain suburban, trail access | 75-85 | Mountain access, good parks |
| 29 | Suburban Miami FL (Coral Gables) | suburban | Coastal suburban, water access | 70-80 | Coastal, moderate parks |

**Research Sources:**
- Local park system reports
- Suburban livability rankings
- Regional outdoor recreation data

---

### Priority 4: Edge Cases (1 location)

**Gap:** Need more extreme low scores and very high scores to test calibration boundaries.

| # | Location | Proposed Area Type | Context | Expected Score Range | Research Notes |
|---|----------|-------------------|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| 30 | Downtown Detroit MI | urban_core | Very low parks, urban decay | 25-35 | Extreme low score test case |

**Research Sources:**
- Trust for Public Land ParkScore (Detroit typically ranks low)
- Urban green space studies
- City park system reports

## Research Methodology

### Step 1: Primary Research Sources

1. **Trust for Public Land ParkScore**
   - URL: https://www.tpl.org/parkscore
   - Provides: Park access scores, park acreage, spending per resident
   - Use: Cross-reference with our target scores

2. **Outside Magazine "Best Towns"**
   - Annual rankings of best outdoor recreation towns
   - Use: Validate high-scoring locations (Boulder, Bend, Asheville, etc.)

3. **Men's Journal Outdoor Recreation Rankings**
   - Rankings of best places for outdoor activities
   - Use: Validate mountain towns and outdoor recreation hubs

4. **State Tourism Board Data**
   - Outdoor recreation participation rates
   - Trail system rankings
   - Park system quality reports

5. **Academic Research**
   - Urban green space accessibility studies
   - Park access equity research
   - Outdoor recreation participation studies

### Step 2: Scoring Methodology

For each location, research should provide:

1. **Primary Score Indicator:**
   - ParkScore ranking (if available)
   - Outdoor recreation rankings
   - Expert assessments from multiple sources

2. **Supporting Data:**
   - Park acreage per capita
   - Trail system quality/quantity
   - Water access (beaches, lakes, rivers)
   - Outdoor recreation participation rates

3. **Relative Positioning:**
   - How does this location compare to known benchmarks?
   - Is it better/worse than similar locations in our panel?

### Step 3: Target Score Assignment

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- **90-100:** World-class outdoor recreation (Boulder, Truckee, Lake Placid)
- **80-89:** Excellent outdoor access (Seattle, Portland, Bethesda)
- **70-79:** Good outdoor access (Santa Monica, Park Slope)
- **60-69:** Moderate outdoor access (Miami Beach, suburban locations)
- **50-59:** Limited outdoor access (mid-range urban cores)
- **40-49:** Poor outdoor access (desert cities, low-park urban)
- **30-39:** Very poor outdoor access (dense urban, limited parks)
- **20-29:** Extremely poor outdoor access (urban decay, minimal parks)

**Validation Rules:**
- Target scores should align with external rankings
- Relative ordering should match external assessments
- Document source for each target score
- Note if multiple sources conflict

## Next Steps

1. **Research Phase:** Gather external research for all 30 locations
2. **Validation Phase:** Compare research findings to current targets, adjust as needed
3. **Calibration Phase:** Run calibration script with expanded panel
4. **Analysis Phase:** Evaluate calibration metrics (R², MAE, max error)
5. **Iteration Phase:** Refine component scoring based on calibration results

---

## Notes

- **Current R² (0.33):** Low R² suggests systematic issues beyond sample size. Expanding panel will help, but component scoring may also need refinement.
- **High-Error Locations:** Pay special attention to locations with current errors >15 points (Denver, Park City, Times Square, Santa Monica, etc.)
- **Area Type Balance:** Expanded panel improves exurban representation from 1 to 5 locations
- **Score Range:** Expanded panel improves low/mid-range coverage from 6 to 14 locations
